# fallingblocktweaks

Makes falling blocks fall when hit with a projectile, any maybe other things later...

### Configuration
The projectiles that can cause a falling block to fall can be configured by modifying the entity type tag `fallingblocktweaks:trigger_fall_entities` through a data pack. This includes arrows, spectral arrows, and tridents by default.
